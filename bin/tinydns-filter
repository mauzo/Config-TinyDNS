=head1 NAME

tinydns-filter - Filter a tinydns data file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    tinydns-filter [filter ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The file format used by L<tinydns-data(8)> is designed primarily to be
easily machine-readable, and can be rather verbose and inflexible for
manual editing. This program passes such a file through a series of
filters, which extend the format in useful ways.

The list of filters is provided on the command line. The data file is
read from stdin, and the filtered file is printed to stdout. If a filter
takes arguments, they should be specified as C<filter=arg1,arg2>.

For a list of filters, see L<Config::TinyDNS|Config::TinyDNS/FILTERS>.
